                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The One London Re-Identification platform has been purpose-built to support Integrated Care Boards (ICBs),
                        providing secure and efficient re-identification of patient records at scale.
                        Designed to seamlessly integrate with Business Intelligence (BI) tools,
                        the platform empowers analysts and data teams to unlock critical insights while maintaining stringent data protection standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The platform uses a permission-based model to verify user-patient relationships, cross-checking
                        with patient data from the Personal Demographic Service (PDS). It ensures privacy by redacting
                        patient details when access is not authorised, maintaining compliance and security.
                    </p>
